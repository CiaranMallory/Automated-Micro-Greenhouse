# Automated-Micro-Greenhouse
This repository contains my Arduino code for my Automated Micro-Greenhouse project. 
The code is used to control 3 pieces of equipment, a fan,
water pump and LED strips intended to keep the temperature inside the greenhouse at a certain 
value as well as the soil at a certain moisture. 
The equipment is dependent on input from 2 sensors, a moisture sensor and a temperature sensor.
